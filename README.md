1. Application of design / patterns
- Repository is used alongside dependency injection to abstract away the data enquiry implementation details so that the implementation can be substituted without affecting its consumers
- Different calculators are used for each kind of service so that when a new service is added or the calculation of a particular service is changed it doesn't affect the others

2. Research time breakdown
- ASP.NET core: 5h
- ASP.NET MVC: 4h
- HTML5, CSS base and JavaScript: 4h
- Bootstrap: 3h
- Entity framework core: 4h
- API with ASP.Net MVC: 5h
- Typescript: 3h
- Angular: 24h
- Repository pattern: 3h
- SOLID architecture principles: 5h


3. Things haven't been done yet
- CSS framework: your choice, however it must be CSS preprocessor (SASS, SCSSâ€¦)
- Application of a state management library would be a plus
- Application of ES6 or Typescript would be a plus 
- Show confirmation dialog after clicking buy button

4. Problem
- The application still has bugs however the bugs can bypass to continue running

5. Developing evironment
- Visual Studio 2019

6. Steps for running application
- Install/update npm
- Build angular application from the CLI
- Run the application from visual studio 2019 (click 'Yes' when the message box shows up)
